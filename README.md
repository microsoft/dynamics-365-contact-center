# Project

The Microsoft Omnichannel Add-on is transforming customer engagement through Generative AI technology across various communication channels. It serves as an AI-centric contact center solution compatible with any CRM or third-party (3P) software. This add-on enables customers to leverage Dynamics 365 Omnichannel (OC) along with AI functionalities within their preferred CRM system.

Built upon the Dynamics Contact Center Platform (DCCP) infrastructure, the Omnichannel Add-on extends its capabilities by seamlessly integrating OC and AI features with existing 3P solutions. Agents have the flexibility to utilize the add-on in either Embedded mode, where the 3P CRM serves as the primary user experience (UX) with OC/AI functionalities embedded, or Standalone mode, where Dynamics OC/AI capabilities take precedence while maintaining connectivity with 3P CRM data.

# Prerequisites
1. [Set up D365 Contact Center embedded experience](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/contact-center/administer/set-up-embedded-experience?branch=main)
2. Install Node [latest version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
3. git clone `https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics-365-contact-center.git`

# CTIDriver Setup

The CTI driver serves as a bridge between the Microsoft Omnichannel Add-on and Salesforce CRM, allowing for the integration of telephony features into the CRM environment.
 
**Note:** These steps can be omitted if the default CTIDriver file is used. 

## CTIDriver Extention for Salesforce and ServiceNow

### Salesforce Extension

6. Host the compiled file (dist/SFExampleCTIDriver.js) on a CDN and include the CDN URL as a query parameter in the CCaaS URL.

    Note: It does not need to be a CDN URL, any URL with public access will also work 
     
    The format of the URL should be: 
     
    `https://<example-ccaas-domain>/widget/index.html?dynamicsUrl=https://msdynccaasdev.crm.dynamics.com&ctiDriverUrl=<CDN-url>`
    
    **example-ccaas-domain**: `https://ccaas-embed-prod.azureedge.net` 
     
    Replace `<CDN-url>` with the actual URL of the hosted compiled file on the CDN. 

7. Update the Salesforce Call center definition file (imported in prerequisite) by replacing the `<ctiDriverUrl>` parameter with the URL generated in Step 6.
