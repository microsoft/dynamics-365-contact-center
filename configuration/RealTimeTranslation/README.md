# Enable real-time translation for conversations

## Prerequisites

The real time translation behavior is defined by the web resource, therefore, verify the following checklist:

- As an administrator, deploy a translation resource and get a translation key. For information, see [How to sign up for Translator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-how-to-signup).

  > [!NOTE] Make sure you create the translation resource for the "Global" location.

- All the agents and supervisors should have "Omnichannel agent" or "Omnichannel supervisor" role.

## What does this sample do?

The webResourceForCCaaS.js is a sample web resource that you can use to enable real-time translation of the conversation messages exchanged between the customer and the agent. Perform the following steps before using the sample:

1. Directly download the file and change the API key for the translation API engine that is used in your organization, in `webResourceForCCaaS.js` at:

```
	bingTranslateApiClientSecret: '<please add your own azure translation api key>',
	googleTranslateApiClientSecret: '<please add your own Google translation v2 api key>',
	useAzureTranslationApis: true,//please override it to false if planning to use Google translation v2 api
```

      You can make additional changes in the web resource logic as per your business needs.

2. Add this javascript file as a web resource to your organization. Follow the instructions in the topic [Add a web resource for real time translation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/omnichannel/developer/how-to/add-web-resource-real-time-translation) to copy its URL in the Customer Service admin center app, and enable the real-time translation feature in Omnichannel for Customer Service.
